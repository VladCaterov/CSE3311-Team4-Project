## Maverick: A UTA Story

### The Story

On a hot and blistering morning, you wake up at a random residence hall at UTA. You approach your computer and realize that it is exam day. You realize that you have left your backpack at home. As you exit your residence, Blaze, the school mascot, is outside waiting for you. Blaze seems worried that you may fail all of your exams if you do not have any equipment. They advise you to seek out the UTA bookstore to retrieve your items. After collecting your tools to conquer the day, you must visit the UTA library and the MAC to prepare for your exams. Preparation will include both physical and mental activities. When you feel ready, you may go visit whichever building you are prompted for. It will be here where you will face a challenging boss and hopefully ace your exam. This cycle repeats itself until you finish your exams. Upon successful completion, you arrive back to your residence to end your day.
